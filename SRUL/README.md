# Real Time Editor 3.2.0.0 with In-Game Mini Editor

## Please give rate and feedback

TL;DR: I can't explain all the features or how to use it in 1 go,
You can join steam groupchat, to ask question if you get confused.
```https://s.team/chat/JMkp2A9D```

**Disclaimer:**
This mod collects your steam username from the game for aesthetical editor display
and CPU id in order to create a unique ID for the donators,
but nothing will be done with the collected data except for the benefit of this mod.

**Also sorry for the ads, if it bothers you, I can give you a free day of ads. Just send me your unique ID. Without ads, it will really boost up the trainer performance up to 2X times if you want to try.**

This can be used to assist you in modding. Lots of creator tools' editable fields are covered in here,
for you to test the effects.

**Important:**
This is not a usual/integrated MODS. You need to find the tools and run them manually.
Currently, there is no way yet to bring up the tools from inside the games.

Find & unzip **SRHelper.zip** in (example):
```
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\314980\2840178069\SRHelper.zip
```
or
```
C:\SteamLibrary\steamapps\workshop\content\314980\2840178069\3.1.1.0.zip
```

**For those who encounter missing files error, please make sure the file [meta . sr] exists in the same folder and is about 400kb in size as of now (506 options, most are editable).**

New features will eventually be updated and you can choose whether to update or not. You just need to click the update button to fetch the current data revision in the form of a JSON update, except if there is a new binary, you probably need to resubscribe.

**Recommended to play in windowed mode, with or without fullscreen.**

## Requirements:

7. Wait for the trainer to load the game
8. After all the checkboxes are checked automatically

**If the trainer won't run, turn OFF AV/Firewall,
as it gives a false positive result due to the nature of game hack software just like cheat engine.**

### Unit Editor

will modify the entire unit model stat for the current savegame.**
